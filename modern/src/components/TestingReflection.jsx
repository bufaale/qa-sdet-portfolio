     <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
       The software industry is experiencing a paradox. We have more access to tools, frameworks, and AI-generated knowledge than ever before — and yet,
       many still measure value by how many languages or libraries someone knows.
     </p>

     <p className="text-gray-400 mt-6">
       In reality, the real value of a software engineer or QA today isn’t their syntax recall,
       but their ability to think clearly, solve problems, and make sound decisions when assisted by AI.
     </p>

     <p className="text-gray-400 mt-6">
       The knowledge of programming languages or frameworks is now democratized. It’s just a prompt away.
       What truly sets someone apart is how they <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">use</span> that knowledge:
     </p>

     <ul className="mt-6 text-left text-gray-300 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
       <li>Can they analyze trade-offs between multiple AI-generated options?</li>
       <li>Do they follow best practices even under pressure?</li>
       <li>Do they apply design patterns and testing strategies consistently?</li>
       <li>Are they effective at making good decisions in complex systems?</li>
       <li>Can they automate the right things without blindly relying on tools?</li>
     </ul>

     <p className="text-gray-400 mt-6 italic">
       The future belongs to those who can collaborate with AI, not compete with it — to those who bring
       <span className="text-blue-400 font-semibold"> judgment, experience, and intention</span> to every task.
